    "section": "",
    "text": "What is the analysis question?\nBe very clear about the goal of the analysis. Do you want to describe, predict, or explain?\nExplictly state the target measures for estimation. What is the population of interest? Who should be being compared? What conditions or outcomes are important? Which summary measures should be reported (difference in proportions, risk ratio, risk difference, conditional or marginal effect)? How should events affecting the interpretation (missing data, loss-to-follow-up, death, service changes) be handled?\nThen measure how the available data differ from the data required. Do we have the data for the target population? For the desired outcomes? How might the data we have be biased? How will this be accomodated in the research?\nDraw the underlying premises in terms of a directed acyclic graph, or DAG\nThe British Medical Journal’s advice for avoiding analytical errors\n\n\nDesign the tables and figures\nBefore data are accessed, draw up the exact format of the analysis output. Create tables with headings and row descriptions, and graphs with labeled axes and descriptions. This is helpful to ensure the estimands have been stated sufficiently clearly.\n\n\nWrite pseudocode\nOutline the code needed to create the tables and figures as designed.\n\n\nWork reproducibly\nAutomate\n\n\nPublish code and analysis\nWe default to open - per NHS Guidelines\nInclude the code as part of the output\nGet a DOI for the output\nArchive the project\n\n\nGo back to your stakeholders\nPresent your analysis widely\nShow one table or graph per slide\nPut the conclusion as the slide title\nAsk what surprises the audience about the analysis\n\n\nScience before Statistics\nRichard McElreath on How to choose variables for models\n\n\nAn Honest Plan\nFrom Richard McElreath’s An honest plan for modest research\n\nONE. What are we even trying to learn? Too much research nominates some big problem, finds some data that is metaphorical related to it, computes some (adjusted) associations, then tells a story about the significant results. Along the way, it’s not clear what we’ve learned, because there was no clear quantitative goal at the start. We need to define the phenomenon, the alternative explanations, and what estimates would help us distinguish among them or refine them.\n\n\nTWO. What is the ideal data for achieving the goals from ONE? This must be argued using an explicit, logical or computational model of the phenomenon. Prove it. Don’t appeal to intuition. Simulate or deduce. Yes, everything will depend upon assumptions. But a conclusion that doesn’t depend upon assumptions is rarely of value. Data themselves are insufficient.\n\n\nTHREE. What data do we actually have? What data can we acquire? How are these data sources different from the ideal on TWO? What is missing? Which proxies exist? How does error creep in? What are the causes of the missing data and measurement error? Is there selection bias? Nearly always. So model it as well. These are generative modeling assumptions, and we need them for the next part.\n\n\nFOUR. Is there a statistical way to use TWO and THREE to learn about ONE? Again, this must be demonstrated logically. Ad hoc, non-generative estimators can work if you get lucky, but their track record is very poor. Prove the analysis will work on synthetic data or otherwise do your best to describe the problems that concern you. But the usual tactic of “we cannot exclude confounding but here are the associations and we want to base policy on the notion they are causal” is neither justifiable nor ethical.”",

And where do people go when they’re released from hospital? Do they go straight home, or stay at a local care centre first?\nWe are studying patient pathways into and out of our hospitals. Knowing the answer to these questions helps tailor healthcare, which reduces stays in hospital and waits for people with scheduled care.\nWe’ll publish a briefing paper with our analysis combined with four other UK regions this autumn.\n\n\nWaitlists\nMillions of people are waiting for NHS care, they’re waiting longer than ever, and the waitlist is growing. How do we prioritise who gets care? How should the NHS spend it’s funding to shorten waitlists?\nWe’ve just begun to measure the consequences of longer waitlists within the NHS. We’re determining which specialties have patients who are using the most healthcare while they’re waiting. This will let us identify patients and procedures that could be priorised (to save patient suffering and to more efficiently spend NHS resources).\n\n\nHousing and Health\nOur homes affect our health. In 2025 we will be working with our local authorities to prioritise housing accomodation and support for people with serious medical conditions.\n\n\nChildren’s Mental Health\nWe recently finished a big project working to understand inequalities in children’s mental healthcare.\nRead a blog post about mental health prescribing to children. Or a post about children’s treatment by specialist mental health doctors. Check out our briefing paper for policy makers. Or wade into our academic research article.(fix links)",
