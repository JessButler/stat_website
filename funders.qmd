# Funding Overview {.unnumbered}

Our work is supported by several grants.

### Health Foundation Funding

We have been funded by The Health Foundation for £900,000 and is running through 2026.  

The Health Foundation has created analytics teams embedded at five local NHSes across the UK (Grampian, Leeds, Liverpool, Northwest London and Wales). These teams make up the Networked Data Lab. 

The project goal is for the 5 sites to link large-scale, high-security health data, then create open software tools and analysis to help national and local leaders improve care.
